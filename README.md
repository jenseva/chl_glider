## About the project

Glider chlorophyll data varies from deployment to deployment causing deployments to be difficult to use for analyses that require times spanning more than one mission. We have the aim to provide an adjusted chlorophyll product that will use a long-timeseries record of satellite chlorophyll to provide a reference by which our data can be adjusted. We will test using the long-timeseries ESA CCI chlorophyll product as a reference for merging our in-situ data. 

Initial efforts at providing an adjusted chlorophyll product began years ago but fell by the wayside because the processing ironically used data from the MODIS sensor which then reached EOL. The timing is good for this project to move forward as the CCI merged satellite products are reaching a maturity level where they can be useful to groups like ours. Within the past year, higher resolution data are now available and the data are now updated regularly enough for our use case.
